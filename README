Gavilan College
CSIS 10 - BASIC Programming
Professor: Frank Thompson
Student: J. Gavin Ray

5/11/12
This is my coursework from my  first programming course taken at Gavilan 
College in the Fall of 2011.  The main thrust of this course was not the
programming, but rather Mr. Thompson stressed the logic on how thing work
to ensure all of the students grasped the basic understanding on how
programs work.  The assignments that were not imagined by Mr. Thompson
were found in our textbook - QBasic Fundamentals and Style (Second Edition).

Note:
The assignments we're submitted in .rtf (Rich Text Format), it includes
stand alone code followed by screen shots of the compiler when the code
is executed.  In order to really see the code you need to download the
files and open them in a wordpad type program (they are larger than normal
due to the images contained within).
